Simple JS click game utilizing Jquery. A random target number between 1-120 is generated and the four crystal similarly are generated random values between 1 and 12.

Players need to click between each crystal to reach the target number. Going over the target number results in a player loss and reset the game. Reaching the target number also resets the game and results in a player win.

Game is styled using CSS.
